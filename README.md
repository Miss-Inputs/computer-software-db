Eh, how to describe things...

Contains controls, compatibility, category, and other things starting with c for software for computers that require installing stuff or putting things in folders or stuff, rather than running everything directly from external media (which would be a lot easier to organize).

Currently targets Mac (68K) and DOS. Windows 3.1 and PPC Mac (OS 8/9) are intended to follow as well, but I would also add any other platform where it becomes relevant.

It's mainly intended for emulation, but I suppose you could use it for real hardware if you have some creative way of doing that. But it's mainly so that launchers for games on these platforms can have controls mapped and configure emulators automatically and whatnot.

It'll make sense when it's used, I guess.
